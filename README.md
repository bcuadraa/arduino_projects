# Arduino Projects completed using the Arduino Starter Kit, English Projects Book!
## Overview 
###### As part of my training at the Center for Neural Science at New York University, I have been following the instructions from the Arduino Starter Kit (linked in the "helpful links" section) to create very fun projects! Arduino makes it very easy to program microcontrollers, which are essentially tiny computers. First, the Arduino board reads inputs such as light on a sensor or the pressing of a switch. Then it turns it into an output, such as activating a motor. Each of the projects I have been working on can be found in their separate section below, highlighting what is necessary for the arduino board circuitry to work, the code that is uploaded to generate the function, and the personal lessons that I have learned from each project along the way! 

#### Project 1: "Get to Know Your Tools"
###### The first project does not include code because it is meant to help you get to know the different components and tools that the Arduino Kit includes, as well as the basic principles of electricity, so it is not included in the repository.

##### Tools 101:

##### General Codes (used in every project) and what they do:

#### Project 2: "Spaceship Interference"
##### Main Idea:
###### For my second project, I created a simulation of the control panel of a spaceship, with the purpose of having a default green light when everything is under control, and pressing an "emergency switch" to turn on two red lights, to express that there is an emergency.
