# Arduino Projects completed using the Arduino Starter Kit!
## Overview 
###### As part of my training at the Center for Neural Science at New York University, I have been following the instructions from the Arduino Starter Kit (linked in the "helpful links" section) to create very fun projects! Arduino makes it very easy to program microcontrollers, which are essentially tiny computers. The Arduino board reads inputs such as light on a sensor or the pressing of a switch. Then it turns it into an output, such as activating a motor. In my repository, you can find each of the codes for the separate projects, labeled by the date and the project number. 

### **Project one does not include code, as it is meant to help you get to know the distinct tools that the Arduino Kit includes, therefore my first project online is project two**

### Project 2: "Spaceship Interference"
