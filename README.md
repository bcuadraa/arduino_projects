# Arduino Projects completed using the Arduino Starter Kit!
## Overview 
###### As part of my training at the Center for Neural Science at New York University, I have been following the instructions from the Arduino Starter Kit (linked in the "helpful links" section) to create very fun projects! Arduino makes it very easy to program microcontrollers, which are essentially tiny computers. The Arduino board reads inputs such as light on a sensor or the pressing of a switch. Then it turns it into an output, such as activating a motor.
