# Arduino Projects completed using the Arduino Starter Kit!
## Overview 
###### As part of my training at the Center for Neural Science at New York University, I have been following the instructions from the Arduino Starter Kit (linked in the "helpful links" section) to create very fun projects! Arduino makes it very easy to program microcontrollers, which are essentially tiny computers. The Arduino board reads inputs such as light on a sensor or the pressing of a switch. Then it turns it into an output, such as activating a motor. In my repository, you can find each of the codes for the separate projects, labeled by the date and the project number. 

#### Project 1
###### The first project does not include code because it is meant to help you get to know the different components and tools that the Arduino Kit includes, as well as the basic principles of electricity, so it is not included in the repository.

#### Project 2: "Spaceship Interference"
##### Main Idea:
###### For my second project, I created a simulation of the control panel of a spaceship, with the purpose of having a default green light when everything is under control, and pressing an "emergency switch" to turn on two red lights, to express that there is an emergency. 

##### Arduino Board: 

##### Code:
